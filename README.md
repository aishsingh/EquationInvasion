# Equation Invasion
Equation Invasion is a fun and engaging mathematical learning tool. A game that will help students enjoy the process of learning, and help improve their ability to think on the spot and apply past knowledge. Rather than always using the standard method of teaching mathematics on a whiteboard and using a textbook, Equation Invasion is developed specifically to give children a fun and interative learning experience.
